My Data is the rank distribution of the game Valorant throughout episode 5, which is 5 months long. Rank distribution is basically the percentage of players that are in each rank. The higher the percentage, the more players are contained in that rank. I chose this data set for my project because Valorant is a game I play frequently and rank distribution is a topic that is well discussed. Putting this data on a graph just makes it easier for people to visualize it.
